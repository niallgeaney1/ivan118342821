        <h2 id="football">Football</h2>
        	<p>From a very young age I have had a passion for Gaelic Football. I play football with my home club, Dingle at senior and under 21 level. I also played football with my school, Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne. We won the Corn Ui Mhuiri cup last year which was a big achievement for the school. Also this year the Dingle senior team made the County Championship Final but we fell short to Dr.Crokes of Killarney. I enjoy football because it keeps the body healthy and gives you a break from the outside world. I also enjoy it because it allows you to make lots of new friends
        
        
        <h2 id="football">Basketball</h2>
        <p>Over the last few years I have had a passion for basketball, in particular the NBA. I dont play the sport as there is no team available to play on but I do enjoy watching it. My favourite team in the NBA are the Oklahoma City Thunder. I enjoy watching the two superstars on that team, Russell Westbrook and Paul George. Hopefully this year the team can progress to the next level and win the championship.</p>
            
        <h2 id="football">Golf</h2>
        	<p>Another sport in which i enjoy is Golf. I enjoy playing Pitch & Putt during the summer back at home and occasionally playing golf on the local course. I love to watch the big competitons, including the 4 major tournaments, The Augusta Masters, The US Open, The British Open and the US PGA Championship. My favourite players to watch are Tiger Woods, Ricky Fowler and Rory McIlroy.</p>
